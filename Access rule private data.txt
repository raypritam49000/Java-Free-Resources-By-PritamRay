Note:-It means for each private data member compiler create a public access method:-

class Outer
{
private int i;

class In
{
}

}

During compilation:-

class Outer extends Object
{
private int i;
private String s;

public int access$000()
{
return i;
}

public String access$001()
{
return s;
}

class In
{
}

}
